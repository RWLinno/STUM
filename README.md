## üì¶Dataset

You can download datasets used in the paper via this link: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vtfAlMufZJxzoLsdJXFasE39pfc1Xcqn?usp=sharing)
or use `./download_datasets.sh` to download datasets.

## ‚≠êQuick Start
1. train and save the baselines.
```
python main.py [--device] [--dataset] [--year] [--model_name] [-seed] [--batch_size]
... # please import the model from the code
```

2. train the vanilla version STUM model.
```
python train_stum_ori.py --stlora
```

3. train a STUM model enhanced by STGNNs. 
```
# A. we train together
python main.py [-dataset] [-device] [-pre_train] [-seed] [-epochs] ...
# B. reload the pre-trained STGNNs used in (more efficient)

```
